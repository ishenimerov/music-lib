    FROM songs s
    JOIN artists a ON s.artist_id = a.artist_id
    JOIN albums b ON s.album_id = b.album_id

    FROM songs s
    JOIN artists a ON s.artist_id = a.artist_id
    WHERE YEAR(s.release_date) = 2022
    GROUP BY s.song_title, a.artist_name, s.release_date
    HAVING COUNT(*) > (
        SELECT AVG(songs_per_artist)
        FROM (
            SELECT COUNT(*) AS songs_per_artist
            FROM songs
            WHERE YEAR(release_date) = 2022
            GROUP BY artist_id
        ) AS subquery
